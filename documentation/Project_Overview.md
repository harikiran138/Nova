# Project Overview: Nova Agent CLI

## Introduction
Nova is a command-line AI assistant that runs entirely on your local machine using Ollama models. It is designed to be a privacy-focused, local-first alternative to cloud-based AI agents.

## Key Features
- **Local Intelligence**: Uses Ollama to run LLMs (like Llama 3, Mistral) locally.
- **Tool Use**: Can perform file operations, execute shell commands, and fetch web content.
- **Safety**: Implements strict sandboxing for file operations and an allowlist for shell commands.
- **Docker Support**: Fully containerized environment for easy deployment and isolation.

## Target Audience
- Developers who want a local AI assistant.
- Privacy-conscious users who prefer keeping their data on their machine.
- Researchers experimenting with local LLMs and agentic workflows.

## Getting Started
Refer to the `README.md` in the root directory for installation and usage instructions.
