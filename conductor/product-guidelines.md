# Product Guidelines - Nova

## Visual Identity & UX
- **Aesthetic**: Cyberpunk/Sci-Fi. The interface should feel like a futuristic console, utilizing neon accents (greens, magentas, cyans) and high-contrast layouts.
- **Interactivity**: The TUI must be highly interactive, using tree-based visualizations to represent tasks, plans, and the agent's decision-making process.
- **Feedback**: Provide immediate visual feedback for all operations using progress bars, status indicators, and clear animations.

## Communication & Tone
- **Tone**: Professional & Precise. Communication should be efficient, objective, and strictly informative, minimizing unnecessary conversational filler.
- **Clarity**: Use structured output (checklists, trees, tables) to present complex information clearly.

## Decision Making & Logic
- **Transparency**: The agent's reasoning process must be visually traceable via the tree-based task representation.
- **Precision**: Decision-making should be grounded in the verified ReAct loop, ensuring every action has a clear justification.
